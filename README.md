# Pneumonia Disease Detection using VGG16

This repository contains a machine learning model built using the VGG16 architecture to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled chest X-rays and uses transfer learning from the pre-trained VGG16 network to perform binary classification (pneumonia or normal). The project also includes a web interface using **Streamlit** to predict pneumonia from user-uploaded X-ray images.

## Project Structure
- `chest_xray/`: Contains the dataset for training, validation, and testing.
- `my_model.keras`: The saved model after training.
- `app.py`: The Streamlit app to predict pneumonia from an uploaded X-ray image.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

- `tensorflow` (for model training and prediction)
- `streamlit` (for the web app interface)
- `numpy` (for numerical computations)
- `Pillow` (for image processing)
- `os` (for handling file paths)

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow streamlit numpy Pillow
```

## How to Use

### 1. Train the Model
To train the model on the pneumonia dataset:

1. Download the dataset and place the `train`, `val`, and `test` folders under `chest_xray/`.
2. Run the following script to train the model:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will:
- Load the chest X-ray images.
- Preprocess the images with data augmentation for training.
- Train a model using VGG16 as a base model with custom layers.
- Save the trained model as `my_model.keras`.

### 2. Run the Streamlit Web App

To use the model for prediction via a web interface:

1. Make sure you have the trained model (`my_model.keras`) saved.
2. Run the following command to start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. Upload a chest X-ray image (in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` format) via the web interface to get the pneumonia prediction.

### 3. Model Architecture

- The model uses the **VGG16** architecture with pre-trained weights from ImageNet.
- It includes additional custom layers for binary classification:
  - Flatten layer
  - Dense layer with 256 units and ReLU activation
  - Dropout layer with a rate of 0.5
  - Output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification

### 4. Model Training

The model is trained for 5 epochs using:
- Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001
- Binary cross-entropy loss function
- Accuracy as the evaluation metric

After training, the model is saved as `my_model.keras` for later use in prediction tasks.

### 5. Prediction

After the model is trained and the app is running, upload a chest X-ray image to get the prediction results. The prediction will tell you if the X-ray indicates pneumonia or is normal, with the confidence of the model's decision.

## Example

- Upload an image of a chest X-ray.
- The app will display the result: whether the X-ray indicates pneumonia or is normal, along with the prediction confidence.
